	<p>
		Computer science is too big of a subject, so interesting that it would be sad to limit yourself
		to one field. That's why I try to learn and touch to as many fields, subject, and technologies
		in computer science (did I hear Jack of all trade in the back?). And you name it:
	</p>
	<ul class="list-disc w-full px-8">
		<li>Web development</li>
		<li>System and low-level programming</li>
		<li>Cybersecurity and pentesting</li>
		<li>AI and machine learning</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		That's why I prefer to refer to myself simply as a Software Engineer. Of course, I don't not
		claim to master every or any of those fields, but I definitively know what where are, and
		practice them when I can.
	</p>
	<p>So yeah, that's all.</p>
